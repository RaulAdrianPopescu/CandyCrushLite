Irina discovered a new computer game! The screen displays a sequence of N number of colored globe. The colors are represented by numbers ranging from 0 to 9.
A sub-sequence is composed of at least 3 identically colored globes, arranged one after the other. Irina, as the player, has a special bow at her disposal. Whenever she looses an arrow at a subsequence,
it is destroyed and the elements following that subsequence shift in its place. The game is won once there are no more globes in the sequence or there aren't enough elements to form a sub-sequence.

While Irina is not necessarily the best at this game, she devised the following strategy:

1. She will only fire upon the largest sub-sequence found on the screen.
2. If there are multiple sub-sequences of the same maximal size, she will fire only on the one furthermost left.
